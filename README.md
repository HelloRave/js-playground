## Modules
1. CommonJS modules
    - mainly used in server-side JS apps with Node, as browsers don't support the use of CommonJS
2. ESModules
    - Node used to only support CommonJS to implement modules, but nowadays it also supports ESmodules which is a more modern approach
    - currently supported by browser and server-side apps with Node (`package.json` and add `"type": "module"`)
